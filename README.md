Easily convert any Widget into a glass / frosted glass version of itself, following the glassmorphism / glassmorphic  design trend.

## Installation

### 1. Depend on it

Add this to your package's `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml 
dependencies:
    glass:
```


### 2. Install it

You can install packages from the command line:

```bash
$ pub get
..
```

Alternatively, your editor might support pub. Check the docs for your editor to learn more.

### 3. Import it

Now in your Flutter code, you can use:

```Dart
import 'package:glass/glass.dart';
```

## Usage

Simply call .asGlass() <with parameters if needed> on the widget you want to convert to glass.

For example: 

```Dart
Container(
    child: someChild,
).asGlass()
```

A full example can be found in the example directory
