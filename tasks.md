Newest information goes first in each section. Use absolute dates.

## Current state
- **glass 2.1.0 is published on pub.dev** (2026-11-03). `main` is at or ahead of the `v2.1.0` tag.
- Release flow is fully automated (AGENTS.md §6): Conventional Commits on `main` → release-please
  opens a release PR → the human merges it → `vX.Y.Z` tag → `publish.yml` publishes to pub.dev.
  - Requires the `RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN` Actions secret (set) and pub.dev automated publishing for
    `Zachariah-Abraham/glass` with tag pattern `v{{version}}` (enabled).
- With Flutter 3.47.7 / Dart 3.13.5 (FVM `stable`): root and `example/` `flutter analyze` are
  clean, and `flutter test` passes in both (10 widget tests in `test/glass_widget_test.dart`, one
  toggle test in `example/test/widget_test.dart`).
- `pubspec.yaml` `version:` is managed by release-please. Don't edit it by hand, and keep it as
  plain `x.y.z` (no `+N`).

## In progress
- _(none)_

## Backlog (suggested, not yet approved by the human)
- [ ] Regenerate `doc/api/` with `dart doc`. It's stale (kept on purpose, see Decisions). Use a
      `docs:` commit so it doesn't cut a release.
- [ ] Optional hardening of automated publishing: GitHub tag protection rules for `v*`, and a
      required `pub.dev` environment (AGENTS.md §6).

## Done
- 2026-11-03: Merged PR #10: CI (`ci.yml`), `.pubignore` (archive ~3 MB → ~750 KB), pub.dev
  metadata (`repository`, `issue_tracker`, `topics`; shows after the next release) and
  `flutter_lints` ^5. Deleted the unused Codemagic webhook (no config, no checks).
- 2026-11-03: Released 2.1.0 (`withValues`, minimum Flutter 3.27 / Dart 3.6). First end-to-end
  automated release: release PR #9 merged, tag `v2.1.0` published to pub.dev.
- 2026-11-03: Added root `flutter_lints` config, 10 widget tests, a real example test, example
  cleanup, and the README parameters table. Analyze and tests clean.
- 2026-11-03: Added release-please (`release-please.yml`, config and manifest) and the
  tag-triggered `publish.yml`. Dropped the `+N` build suffix from `version:` so tags match
  pub.dev's `v{{version}}`.
- 2026-10-29: Added `AGENTS.md` (incl. the publishing guide in §6), `CLAUDE.md` and `tasks.md`.

## Decisions made
- 2026-11-03: `flutter_lints` is `^5` because `^6` needs Dart 3.8 and the minimum SDK is Dart 3.6.
- 2026-11-03: Raising the minimum SDK isn't a breaking change (pub resolves users on older SDKs
  to the older release), so it ships as a minor release. Note it in a commit **subject** so it
  reaches the changelog.
- 2026-11-03: Keep the checked-in `doc/api/` (human decision). Regenerate rather than delete.
- 2026-10-29: Raising the minimum Flutter version for `withValues` is OK.

## Open questions for the human
- Do you want the remaining backlog items done? Hardening is deferred by the human.
